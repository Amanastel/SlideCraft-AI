- MySQL Database (presentation storage)
- Google Gemini API Key (AI content and image generation)
- AWS S3 Account (presentation asset storage)
- Required Python packages for presentation processing

### Installation

1. **Clone the PowerPoint Generator**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amanastel/SlideCraft-AI
   cd SlideCraft-AI
   ```

2. **Install PowerPoint generation dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your presentation environment**
   Create a `.env` file or update `configs.ini` with your credentials:
   ```ini
   [MySQLConfig]
   DB_HOST=your_mysql_host
   DB_USERNAME=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=your_database

   [AIConfig]
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ```

4. **Set up presentation asset storage**
   Configure AWS S3 access for storing generated presentation images and assets.

5. **Start the PowerPoint generation server**
   ```bash
   python slide2.py
   ```
   Your PowerPoint generation API will be available at `http://localhost:8086`

### Create Your First PowerPoint Presentation

Once the server is running, you can generate a complete PowerPoint presentation:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8086/api/v1/slides/initiate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": {
      "id": 12345,
      "title": "My Business Presentation",
      "theme": "light",
      "outline": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "Executive Summary",
          "points": ["Market opportunity", "Our solution", "Financial projections"]
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "title": "Market Analysis", 
          "points": ["Market size", "Target audience", "Competitive landscape"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

This will return a `request_id`. Use it to generate your complete PowerPoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8086/api/v1/slides/generate?id={request_id}
```

**Result**: A professional PowerPoint presentation with multiple slides, professional design, and AI-generated content!
